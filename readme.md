**What is this?**
<br>
This is a Python notebook that creates a transcript from a YouTube url using OpenAI's Whisper transcription model that you can then upload to YouTube using the autosync feature to create captions.
<br>  
**Why use this?**
<br> 
The quality of the OpenAI Whisper model is amazing (I am slightly biased, but seriously, check it out.) You can also use it to transcribe in other languages.
<br> 
<br>
**What do the different model sizes do?**
<br>
Each model size has an improvement in quality â€“ especially with different languages. I've found that for a YouTube video with clear speech, the base model works really well. If you see transcription errors, you can try a larger model.
<br>
<br> 
**Do I need timestamps?**
<br> 
Nope. YouTube's autosync function will match the text to the spoken words and syncs up really well. All you need is each spoken sentence in a .txt file.
<br> 
<br> 
**How do I do this?**
<br> 
Just follow each step. If you've never used Colab of a Python notebook, don't panic. It's super easy and runs in the cloud.
<br> 
<br> 
**Does this cost anything to use?**
<br>
Nope. You can use Colab for free and Whisper is an open source model.
